# Destination Unknown
A working full-stack application using the MERN stack (Node.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, React).

App highlights off-the-beaten-track destinations. Browse suggestions, create your own or search a 3rd party API.
Come to this site for random travel suggestions. These suggestions are not on any top 10 travel list.

## Highlights
**User can browse already created suggestions (sorted by country?)**
**User can add own suggestions.**
**User can pull from 3rd party API to view more suggestions (type in country name, get list of suggestions from Atlas Obscura)**

## Stretch Goals
**Authentication**
Must be logged in to created/edit/delete.

**Two related databases.   1) country model 2) weird places model**
(Unclear if will use 1 model or 2. I would like to attempt 2 related models for the practice, but not sure if that fits in this context).

**Use CSS framework/library Boostrap**

## Maybes
**incorporate google maps**

**Use React Router**
Need 12 routes, which I think may be too many for this app.

## Will Pull From Following Third Party API

 www.triposo.com/api.

Triposo pulls information and images related to a particular city or country, including links to maps page and wiki page.
